<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An organised candidate is a detail-oriented candidate and someone an employer can trust to meet deadlines. This quality is especially important in administrative positions, project management and other roles that require adherence to process and quality.</p>

<p>I am a natural leader. I have eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people. I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I am not in a leadership role because if I do not know the answer, I will at least point them in the right direction. In my last two roles, I was promoted to leadership positions after less than a year with the company.</p>

<p>I am results oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team. In fact, over the past year, I was able to help my team shorten our average product time to market by two weeks.</p>
